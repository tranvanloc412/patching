## Architecture Roles & Responsibilities Summary

Yes, you've correctly understood the architectural layers and stakeholder responsibilities in your patching automation system:

### Interfaces - Contract Definition

- Purpose : Define what functions the tool will perform
- Location : `interfaces`
- Examples : `scanner_interface.py` , `ami_backup_interface.py`
- Stakeholder : Architects & Lead Developers - Define system contracts and capabilities

### Services - Business Logic Implementation

- Purpose : Call infrastructure layer and return structured model data
- Location : `services`
- Examples : `scanner_service.py` , `ami_backup_service.py`
- Stakeholder : Engineers - Implement business logic and data transformation

### Models - Data Structure Validation

- Purpose : Provide structured data that engineers can inspect for expected output
- Location : `models`
- Examples : `instance.py` , `ami_backup.py`
- Stakeholder : Engineers & QA Teams - Verify data structure and validate outputs

### Documentation - Business Understanding

- Purpose : Show project owners what the tool does at a high level
- Location : `documents`
- Examples : `prepatch_workflow.md` , `architecture_flow_mermaid.md`
- Stakeholder : Project Owners & Business Users - Understand tool capabilities and workflows

### Clear Separation of Concerns

1. Interfaces → Define "what" the system can do
2. Services → Implement "how" it's done
3. Models → Structure "what data" is produced
4. Documentation → Explain "why" and "when" to use it
   This architecture ensures:

- Testability : Each layer can be tested independently
- Maintainability : Changes in one layer don't break others
- Clarity : Each stakeholder knows exactly where to look for their concerns
- Scalability : New features can be added following the same patterns
  Your understanding is spot-on for a well-architected enterprise automation system!

## Infrastructure Layer vs External Systems Architecture Analysis

Based on my examination of your codebase, here's a comprehensive analysis of the architecture and recommendations for enhanced code quality and maintainability:

### Current Architecture Overview

Infrastructure Layer ( /infrastructure/ ):

- AWS Clients : `ec2_client.py` , `ssm_client.py`
- Session Management : `session_manager.py`
- Storage Abstraction : `csv_handler.py` , `file_storage.py`
  External Systems Integration :

- AWS EC2 API for instance management
- AWS SSM for connectivity and patch management
- Local file system for data persistence
- Cross-account role assumption for multi-tenant access

### Key Architectural Strengths

1. Clean Separation of Concerns : Infrastructure layer properly abstracts external system interactions
2. Interface-Driven Design : `interfaces` provides clear contracts
3. Dependency Injection : Services are properly decoupled through constructor injection
4. Centralized Error Handling : Recent improvements with \_handle_error methods
